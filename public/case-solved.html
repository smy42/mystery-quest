    <p class="quiz-text">
      You correctly identified the murderer.
      The evidence points clearly to Suspect C.
    </p>

    <p class="quiz-text">
      Suspect C was an acquaintance of the victim and was staying in the same hotel.
      Earlier that evening, the victim willingly let them into the room.
    </p>

    <p class="quiz-text">
      The minibar records confirm that the victim was not alone.
      After leaving the room, Suspect C took the victim’s keycard without being noticed.
    </p>

    <p class="quiz-text">
      Later that night, the stolen keycard was used again.
      Around this time, the victim recorded a voicemail after hearing unusual noises near the room.
      The message marked the moment when the situation changed.
    </p>

    <p class="quiz-text">
      Finally, the guest registry exposed the lie.
      Suspect C claimed to have arrived late, but records show they were already checked in.
    </p>

    <p class="quiz-text">
      During their conversation, the victim discovered that Suspect C had been using stolen keycards
      to access rooms in the hotel without authorization.
    </p>

    <p class="quiz-text">
      Realizing that this information could expose him, Suspect C returned later that night
      and murdered the victim to prevent the truth from coming out.
