            <p class="description">
                The victim was found dead during the night.
                There are no clear witnesses, and the timeline is incomplete.
                Investigators collected several clues, but the evidence only makes sense when combined.

            <p class="description">
                Your task is to analyze each clue, uncover contradictions, and identify the murderer.

            <p class="description">
                Suspect A: A friend of the victim. A hotel employee recalls seeing them together at lunchtime in the
                lobby.
                Suspect A claims nothing unusual happened.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                Suspect B: A reviewed guest staying on the same floor. Due to proximity, investigators checked their
                movements.
                Suspect B was the only other guest registered on that floor.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                Suspect C: An acquaintance of the victim who was also staying in the same hotel.
                Suspect C claims they arrived late and were not involved.
